Hi there!

Thanks for stopping by. My name is Filipe, I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research at the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/people/phd-students).
I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Andy Sun](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/andy-sun).

For applications, I study fleet sizing planning for electrical buses. For methodologies, I study Stochastic Programming, Integer Programming, and Reinforcement Learning. I am particularly interested in applications related to decision making under uncertainty.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to reach out!
