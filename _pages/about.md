Hello there!

Welcome, and thank you for visiting.
I'm Filipe, a passionate professional in the field of Operations Research.
I hold a Ph.D. from the Georgia Institute of Technology,
where I had the privilege of being mentored by Professor Andy Sun.

I'm thrilled to share that I have recently embarked on a new journey as
an Operations Research and Advanced Analytics Consultant at American Airlines.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to reach out!
